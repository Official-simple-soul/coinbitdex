              request and ascertain whether the information we hold about you is
              accurate and up-to-date. If any of your Personal Data is
              inaccurate, you may request to update your information. You may
              also request to delete your Personal Data, with the exception that
              we may refuse your deletion request in certain circumstances, such
              as compliance with law or legal purposes. For data access,
              correction, or deletion requests, please contact{' '}

              please note that, for your protection as well as ours, we shall
              only be able to do so with the proper and verified authorization

              action, we will take all steps as considered necessary in our
              absolute discretion to carry out said verification of the
              requester's identity (including but not limited to a telephone
              call-back or email response from the data owner's email address on
              file, or such procedures as we may in our discretion require) to
              ensure the legitimacy of the request. Due to possible complexities
              and cross-border time differences, we are unable to commit to a
              timeline within which such requests can be fulfilled, and
              CoinbitDex hereby disclaims any liability for any loss or damage
              howsoever suffered as a result of a data access, correction, or
              deletion request not being attended to by us on a timely basis.
              Also, while we aim to respond to data requests without charge, we
              hereby reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee should the
              request prove to be onerous, repetitive, or require additional
